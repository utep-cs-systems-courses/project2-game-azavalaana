  The switch_interrupt_handler is a method that reads the
  four switches from Port 2 in the MSP430. Every switch has
  a different song and tempo so that when one of them is pressed, 
  a song starts playing on the buzzer of the MSP430 at its 
  determined tempo. Also, when any of the switches is pressed, the
  green LED turns on. If any switch ain't pressed, then the red
  LED is on and the MSP430 makes no sound.
